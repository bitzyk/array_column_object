array_column_object
===================

Provides the same functionality like array_column(), but reported to an array of objects.


## Installation

The easiest way to install this library is to use Composer and add the following
to your project's `composer.json` file:

``` javascript
{
    "require": {
        "bitzyk/array_column_object": "~1"
    }
}
```

Then, when you run `composer install`, everything will fall magically into place,
and the `array_column_object()` function will be available to your project, as long as
you are including Composer's autoloader.

_However, you do not need Composer to use this library._

This library has no dependencies and should work on older versions of PHP.
Download the code and include `src/array_column_object.php` in your project, and all
should work fine.
